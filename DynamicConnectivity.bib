abstract = {Adolescents are notorious for engaging in reward-seeking behaviors, a tendency attributed to heightened activity in the brain's reward systems during adolescence. It has been suggested that reward sensitivity in adolescence might be adaptive, but evidence of an adaptive role has been scarce. Using a probabilistic reinforcement learning task combined with reinforcement learning models and fMRI, we found that adolescents showed better reinforcement learning and a stronger link between reinforcement learning and episodic memory for rewarding outcomes. This behavioral benefit was related to heightened prediction error-related BOLD activity in the hippocampus and to stronger functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the striatum at the time of reinforcement. These findings reveal an important role for the hippocampus in reinforcement learning in adolescence and suggest that reward sensitivity in adolescence is related to adaptive differences in how adolescents learn from experience.},

abstract = {15 16 17 Summary 18 Complex learned behaviors involve the integrated action of distributed brain 19 circuits. While the contributions of individual regions to learning have been 20 extensively investigated, understanding how distributed brain networks 21 orchestrate their activity over the course of learning remains elusive. To 22 address this gap, we used fMRI combined with tools from dynamic network 23 neuroscience to obtain time-­‐resolved descriptions of network coordination 24 during reinforcement learning. We found that reinforcement learning 25 involves dynamic changes in network coupling between the striatum and 26 distributed brain networks. Moreover, we found that the degree of flexibility 27 in whole-­‐brain circuit dynamics correlates with participants' learning rate, as 28 derived from reinforcement learning models. Finally, we found that episodic 29 memory, measured in the same participants at the same time, was related to 30 dynamic connectivity in distinct brain networks. These results support the 31 idea that dynamic changes in network communication provide a mechanism 32 for information integration during reinforcement learning.},
